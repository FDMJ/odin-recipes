    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A combination of chili powder and other herbs and spices make a spicy rub for pork chops. Brush with a spicy-sweet glaze in the last 2 minutes of cooking, and take the extra glaze to the table for even more goodness. We enjoyed these chops with simple sauteed zucchini and steamed white rice.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) bone-in center loin pork chops, about 3/4-inch thick</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon white pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Glaze</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup apricot all-fruit spread</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>1 (1 inch) piece ginger root, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons Asian chili-garlic sauce</li>
        <li>½ medium lime, juiced</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely minced fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Step
            <p> Combine water, salt, and sugar in a bowl and stir until the crystals are dissolved. Add pork chops, cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 4 hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 
            <p> Remove pork chops from the brine and shake off excess. Discard the remaining brine. Pat chops dry with paper towels and place on a plate or cutting board.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step
            <p> Combine chili powder, onion powder, salt, and white pepper in a small bowl. Distribute 1/2 of the rub mixture among the 4 chops and rub to coat the entire surface. Turn the chops and repeat. Allow chops to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step
            <p> Meanwhile, combine apricot all-fruit spread, hoisin sauce, ginger, garlic, chili-garlic sauce, and lime juice for the glaze in a medium, microwave-safe bowl.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 
            <p> Microwave mixture on high for 3 minutes, stirring halfway through. Carefully remove glaze and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 
            <p> Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) if recommended by manufacturer. Spray each side of seasoned and rubbed chops with cooking spray.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 
            <p> Place chops in the air fryer in a single layer and air-fry for 8 minutes, turning halfway through.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 
            <p> Brush the tops of the chops with prepared glaze and air-fry until pork chops are no longer pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 
            <p> Sprinkle chops with minced parsley, and serve with remaining glaze.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
